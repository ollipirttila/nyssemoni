This project was is learning project I used to learn React with Redux ([Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template).
Usage of Redux store in such a small app might be a bit overkill, but this app was made in order to learn structures and practices to build more complex apps.

## App features

The app leverages Tampere City's Public Transport Information API [Journeys API](https://data.tampere.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/journeys-api).

### In the app you can:

1. Search for a Tampere region buss stop by name or code
2. Save any stop to your favourite stops for quick access
3. Edit and delete your quick access stops.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

If running for the first time on your machine, run this to install app dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
